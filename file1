A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network you can create in AWS, where you can launchAWS resources EC2 instances. 
Itâ€™s like having your own private space on the internet to keep your resources safe from others.
You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
